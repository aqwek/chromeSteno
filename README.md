# chromeSteno
Welcome!

Here is the ver0.1.0-infdev ChromeSteno files!
ChromeSteno is an in development chrome extension that emulates Plover in the browser for free, no installing. Just checking the box!

Not as simple as that.
This extension is absolutely infuriating.
The bane of my existence.
The main.json is stored at https://github.com/aqwek/steno-dictionary, although it is locally stored here for no reason.
If you want to help, feel free to try.
When you are typing, only one key is translated at a time. No multi-letter chords. And the translation is in the console. Sometimes types it, mostly deletrs it immediately after. I posted this tio tell everyone how much pain I'm in, and for anyone who want's to help. If you do, email it to me at micah.niven@gmail.com (fake name, so no one knows it lol)
Good day!
